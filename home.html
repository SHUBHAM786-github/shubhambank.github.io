<div class=" panel panel-default text-success "><p>Banking in its modern sense evolved in the fourteenth century in the prosperous cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways functioned as a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world. In the history of banking, a number of banking dynasties — notably, the Medicis, the Fuggers, the Welsers, the Berenbergs, and the Rothschilds — have played a central role over many centuries. The oldest existing retail bank is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (founded in 1472), while the oldest existing merchant bank is Berenberg Bank (founded in 1590).</p></div>

      ELSS or Equity Linked Savings Scheme is a type of mutual fund. ELSS Funds have a lock-in of 3 years, which is the shortest lock-in among the various tax-saving schemes in India. Investing in ELSS Funds (also called Tax Saving Funds) is tax deductible under Section 80 C up to Rs 1.5 lakh per annum. The returns on ELSS funds will be taxed as long term capital gains at a 10% rate. Dividends from ELSS funds will also be taxed at 10% under the Dividend Distribution Tax. ELSS funds invest at least 80% of their assets in equity (stocks) and offer a high compounding potential in the long term. You can know more about them here. The minimum annual investment in ELSS funds is Rs 100, although it varies from one fund to another. There is no maximum limit but tax deduction is only available for contributions up to Rs 1.5 lakh per year.
